# ApsimSoil-SSURGO

This repo contains R code for downloading soils data from [SSURGO database](https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov) and converting it into [APSIM](https://http://www.apsim.info/) format.
Code here relies heavily on the [FedData](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FedData/index.html) and [apsimR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apsimr/index.html) packages.
